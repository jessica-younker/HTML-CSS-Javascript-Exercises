A base FarmFoe function.
Define three FarmFoe type functions (e.g. Drone, Bipedal, ATV).
Each type must have a unique property, for example, if it is aerial or ground based.
Define at least 2 specific FarmFoe model functions for each type.
Give each FarmFoe model a different range of health. For example, one model can have health range of 50-80, and another one will have a range of 60-120. To accomplish this, read about the Math.random() function in JavaScript.
Give each FarmFoe model a different range of damage they do using the same technique.
